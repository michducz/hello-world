# hello-world
This is a repository following the tutorial to get back into coding, relearning stuff a couple of years after not learning it all that well in the first place.


This is to try putting a little bit into this little file here, reminding myself how committing changes works.  

I'm currently working as the receptionist for an insurance law firm, but hoping to do more productive things and start a STEM career within a couple of years so as to most productively and profitably use my bachelors degree in physics.
